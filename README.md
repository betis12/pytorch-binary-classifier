# Binary Classification with PyTorch

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing a binary classification model using PyTorch.

## 📌 Description

The model is trained on a custom dataset using:
- PowerTransformer-based feature normalization
- Custom training/validation loop with PyTorch DataLoader
- Binary classification accuracy tracked using `torchmetrics`

> ⚠️ **Note**: The dataset used in this notebook is not included due to privacy or course-related limitations.
